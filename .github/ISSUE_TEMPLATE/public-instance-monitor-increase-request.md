<!--
Game server monitoring causes significantly more network strain on our servers than our other bots. To help mitigate this, we have limited the public bot to only 3 active monitors per Discord user.

However, we are able to manually increase this limit following a review of legitimacy performed by a human being. This process will be mainly automated soon, but for now it is done manually.

In order to receive an increase, please submit this issue with the following information:
  - Your Discord tag (username#1234)
  - A valid invite link to your Discord server
  - The amount of extra server monitors you need

Enter this information after the arrow below on the next line! :>
